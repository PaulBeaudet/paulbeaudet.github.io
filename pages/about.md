## Bio

Implementing and creating technology to be utilized as equalizing force to empower people to work together. Passion for making that gets directed into, open source software development, entrepreneurship, and photography. Many say I'm smart but mostly I see myself as persistent, ready to learn, undeterred by complexity. After all you have to see something scary if you ever want to be brave. Wrapping complexity in simplicity is my idea of minimalism. Its more about having stuff that actually gets used then having less stuff. My focuses are driven by ideas of empowerment and sustainability. Having co-founded Manchester Makerspace, and serving as its educational programs manager, I'm avid proponent of community workspaces and concept of hands on learning. For fun I like to get out into nature and hike, right now I'm working on the 4000 footers in the White Mountains of NH.
